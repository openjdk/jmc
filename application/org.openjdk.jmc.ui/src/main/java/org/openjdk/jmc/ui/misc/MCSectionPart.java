/**
 * <p>
 * MCSectionPart contains common functionality you might want to have in your SectionPart. This is
 * also the base classed used for {@link SectionPart}s in Mission Control.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Design</h2> This section describes how a {@link SectionPart} works and how it's life cycle
 * looks.
 * <h3>Initialization</h3>
 * <p>
 * The initialization a SectionPart process can be divided into these phases:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Object construction</b><br>
 * This is when the constructor of the SectionPart is called. During this phase minimal
 * initialization should be done. Only, e.g., light weight and immutable member variables/constants
 * should be constructed. No widgets should be created and no models should be initialized. The
 * rationale for this is that we want to allow for lazy initialization and avoid initializations
 * bugs when we're constructor chaining. It's also much easier to debug if all the widgets are
 * created in one place. See next phase.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Form initialization</b><br>
 * This is when {@link SectionPart#initialize(IManagedForm)} is called. During this phase
 * SWT-widgets should be created. At this moment we have the input from the {@link ManagedForm}
 * available so it's possible to access the model, but because model initialization could be
 * expensive it should be avoided, if possible. During this phase the {@link SectionSite} for the
 * part is constructed and should be available for classes that want to subclass. Note, you need to
 * call super.initialize(IManagedForm) in {@link SectionPart#initialize(IManagedForm)} method if you
 * override.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Model initialization</b><br>
 * This happens when {@link MCSectionPart#initializePart()} is called and it typically occurs the
 * first time a user flips to a page containing the {@link SectionPart}. During this phase model
 * initialization should be done. In this phase you should set {@link IContentProvider}s for viewers
 * and fill widgets with data. If necessary in a job thread, posting widget updates to the
 * ui-thread.
 * </p>
 * </ul>
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <p>
 * SectionParts has a mechanism for keeping the user interface and the model in sync. Typically you
 * get an update from your model listener, e.g {@link Observable}, saying that the model has
 * changed. At this time you should not update your view but instead call
 * {@link SectionPart#markStale()} and return. The next time the {@link SectionPart} becomes visible
 * {@link MCSectionPart#refreshPart()} is called if the part is stale. At this time the model data
 * is fetched into the widgets, If you modify your model in a way that requires data to be saved you
 * should call {@link SectionPart#markDirty()} and use the {@link SectionPart#commit(boolean)}
 * function.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A {@link SectionPart} can choose to implement {@link IPartSelectionListener} if the part wants to
 * be informed of selection changes that occur on the {@link IManagedForm}. There is no need to add
 * the listener. Just implement the interface. Typically used when you have master/detail dependency
 * between parts.
 * </p>
 * <h3>End of life</h3>
 * <p>
 * When the user closes the editor the {@link IManagedForm} and the editor will check if the
 * {@link SectionPart} is dirty and if so {@link SectionPart#commit(boolean)} will be called. If
 * everything works out OK the dispose method ( {@link SectionPart#dispose()}) will be called. In
 * the dispose method resources should be cleaned up. Call super.dispose() the last thing in dispose
 * method. This ensures that resource are cleaned up the in reversed order that they we're
 * initialized.
 * </p>
 * </ul>
