/**
 * Updates the program with new source code
 * <p>
 * The current implementation is not very efficient, the whole program is updated with every key
 * strike, but it's a pretty clean design otherwise.
 * <p>
 * There are at least two ways to improve efficiency:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Compile in the background, start a widget-polling thread when the text is modified. Easy to
 * implement
 * <li>Keep track of the source-lines and only recompile where it is necessary. Hard to implement
 * </ol>
 * Currently there is a cache which remembers old compilation so it will probably be pretty fast for
 * less than say 10&nbsp;000 lines, but it won't scale and it won't take care of semantic errors in
 * the future. E.g. if we introduce variables or loop constructs.
