   <description>
      This is a release engineering internal &quot;feature&quot;. It just happen
to use the same file format as end user visible features. Its
sole purpose is to list the features that will be exported into
a p2 repository (a.k.a. update site), and provide a default name
for it (rarely seen). No other aspects of it will ever reach
end users. String externalization is NOT supported. Do NOT insert
copyright or other irrelevant stuff in here.
