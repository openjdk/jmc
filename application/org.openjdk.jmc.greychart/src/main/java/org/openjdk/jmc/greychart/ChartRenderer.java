/**
 * Interface for classes capable of drawing a key chart element at a certain position.
 * <p>
 * The rendering typically takes place in the following fashion:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The chart controlling all the renderers will ask each renderer how much space it would need
 * given a certain drawing area, plus clear the rendering area.
 * <li>renderGraph will be called on each renderer with the partition of space alotted to the
 * renderer plus the space used by the chart. It is okay to render in the plot area to produce
 * gridlines etc. The chart will always be rendered last.
