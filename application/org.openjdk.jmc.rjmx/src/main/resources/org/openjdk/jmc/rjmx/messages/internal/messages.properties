JVMSupport_MESSAGE_UNKNOWN_JVM=You are attempting to connect to an unknown JVM. This will most likely not succeed unless you're running the JMX Console, and even then functionality will be limited. \n\nAre you sure you want to continue?
JVMSupport_MESSAGE_JROCKIT_NOT_SUPPORTED=You are attempting to connect to a JRockit JVM. To connect to a JRockit JVM, please use JRockit Mission Control 4.1 for JRockit R28, and JRockit Mission Control 3.1 for JRockit R27. \nIf you connect to a JRockit, functionality will be limited. \n\nAre you sure you want to continue?
JVMSupport_MESSAGE_LEGACY_JVM_CONSOLE=The JVM you are connecting to is not recent enough for full functionality in the JMX Console. For full functionality you need to connect to an Oracle JDK 7u40 or later JVM or an OpenJDK 11+ JVM. Do you still want to connect?
JVMSupport_JROCKIT_NO_LONGER_SUPPORTED=JRockit is no longer supported. Use a 4.x version of Mission Control when connecting to a JRockit.
JVMSupport_JROCKIT_NO_LONGER_SUPPORTED_SHORT=JRockit is no longer supported
JVMSupport_FLIGHT_RECORDER_NOT_SUPPORTED_OLD_HOTSPOT=Flight Recorder is not supported for JVMs with Java versions below 7u4
JVMSupport_FLIGHT_RECORDER_NOT_SUPPORTED_OLD_HOTSPOT_SHORT=Flight Recorder is not supported for JVMs with Java versions below 7u4
JVMSupport_FLIGHT_RECORDER_NOT_FULLY_SUPPORTED_OLD_HOTSPOT=Flight Recorder is not fully supported for JVMs with Java versions below 7u40

JVMSupport_FLIGHT_RECORDER_NOT_SUPPORTED_NOT_HOTSPOT=Flight Recorder is not supported for non HotSpot JVMs
JVMSupport_FLIGHT_RECORDER_NOT_SUPPORTED_NOT_HOTSPOT_SHORT=Flight Recorder is not supported for non HotSpot JVMs
JVMSupport_FLIGHT_RECORDER_NOT_ENABLED=Flight Recorder features are not enabled. To enable this you need to use an Oracle JDK 7u4 or later JVM started with -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -XX:+FlightRecorder, an OpenJDK 8 JFR-enabled JVM, or an OpenJDK 11+ JVM.
JVMSupport_FLIGHT_RECORDER_NOT_ENABLED_SHORT=Flight Recorder features are not enabled
JVMSupport_FLIGHT_RECORDER_DISABLED=Flight Recorder is explicitly disabled. To enable the Flight Recorder, remove -XX:-FlightRecorder from the command line.
