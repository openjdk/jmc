/**
 * This is the default implementation of {@link IConnectionDescriptor}.

 * The Connection Descriptor encapsulates the knowledge for how to connect to another JVM. The
 * connection information is immutable and will not change.
 * <p>
 * The extended properties collection is a set of application specific flags that will be persisted
 * with the connection. It is free to use and change at the application's discretion.

 * If you need to use the extended properties, please note that the key namespace org.openjdk.jmc.*

 * <p>
 * A DefaultJMXConnectionDescriptor has many different properties that can be set. To facilitate the
 * creation of descriptors in an as easy way as possible, an internal builder class is provided.
 * Here is an example on how to create a descriptor that will simply communicate using a reference
 * to the local platform MBean server:
