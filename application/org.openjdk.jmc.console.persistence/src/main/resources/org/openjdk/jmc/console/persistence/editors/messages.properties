InformationSectionPart_WHAT_IS_PERSISTENCE_TITLE=What is JMX Data Persistence?
InformationSectionPart_PERSISTENCE_DESCRIPTION_BEGINNING_TEXT=JMX Data Persistence is a low overhead way to log and view JMX data. This can be useful if you want to:
InformationSectionPart_IT_IS_SEE_TRENDS_TEXT=See trends in your data over a long period of time.
InformationSectionPart_IT_IS_OFFLINE_VIEW_TEXT=Analyze data offline.
InformationSectionPart_IT_IS_SHARE_DATA_TEXT=Share data with other people.
InformationSectionPart_PERSISTENCE_DESCRIPTION_END_TEXT=The JMX attributes/notifications that you choose to log are not limited to the those exposed by the JDK. You can select attributes/notifications from your own applications, or any other application that have MBeans registered on the MBean Server.
InformationSectionPart_HOW_DO_I_USE_TITLE=How do I use it?
InformationSectionPart_HOW_DO_I_USE_DESCRIPTION_TEXT=You configure the attributes/notifications you want to log in the JMX Data Persistence Settings section in the JMX Console. Activate by pressing the icon in the top right corner. See picture below. The JMX data is logged as long as persistence is activated and you have the JMX console connected to the monitored JVM. In <a href='pref.dialog'>Preferences</a> you can set the directory where you want to store the log files and how often you want to rotate the logs.
