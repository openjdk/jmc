JfxPulseDurationRule_CAPTION_PREFERENCE_TARGET_FRAME_RATE=Target frame rate
JfxPulseDurationRule_DESCRIPTION_PREFERENCE_TARGET_FRAME_RATE=The target frame rate of the system. Normally 60 on PCs and 30 for embedded systems.
JfxPulseDurationRule_NAME=Pulse Duration
JfxPulseDurationRule_OK=No problems with excessive rendering pulses were found.
# {0} is a number, {1} is a time period
JfxPulseDurationRule_WARNING={0} of all pulse phases exceeded the {1} target
# {0} is a number
JfxPulseDurationRule_WARNING_LONG=These phases likely act as bottlenecks in the rendering pipeline and are likely preventing the application from rendering at the targeted {0} FPS (frames per second) speed.
