JfxConstants_PULSE_START_DESCRIPTION=The time the pulse started

JfxPulseDurationRule_CAPTION_PREFERENCE_TARGET_FRAME_RATE=Target frame rate
JfxPulseDurationRule_DESCRIPTION_PREFERENCE_TARGET_FRAME_RATE=The target frame rate of the system. Normally 60 on PCs and 30 for embedded systems.
JfxPulseDurationRule_NAME=Pulse Duration
JfxPulseDurationRule_OK=No problems with excessive rendering pulses were found.
# {slowPhaseRatio} is a percentage, {targetTime} is a time period
JfxPulseDurationRule_WARNING={slowPhaseRatio} of all pulse phases exceeded the {targetTime} target
# {0} is a number
JfxPulseDurationRule_WARNING_LONG=These phases likely act as bottlenecks in the rendering pipeline and are likely preventing the application from rendering at the targeted {renderTarget} speed.
