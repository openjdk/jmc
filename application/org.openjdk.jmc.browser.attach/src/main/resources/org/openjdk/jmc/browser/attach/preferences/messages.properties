AttachPreferencePage_BROWSER_REFRESH_INTERVAL=JVM Browser Refresh Interval [ms]:
AttachPreferencePage_CAPTION_AUTO_START=Automatically &start the local management agent if not already started
AttachPreferencePage_CAPTION_SHOW_UNCONNECTABLE=Show unconnectable JVMs
AttachPreferencePage_NOTE_SHOW_UNCONNECTABLE=In order to connect to a JVM that can't be attached to (e.g. connecting to a 32-bit JVM from a 64-bit Mission Control), the management agent has to be started manually by using the JVM flag -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote\nIf this option is unchecked then the JVM browser will hide local JVMs that can't be attached to and that do not have the management agent started.
