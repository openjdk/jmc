# Spelled out names of units, within a given kind of quantity (a subset of the "content types" above).
# Note that unit names are not required. The names of units are only used for two purposes:
# 1) In unit descriptions when selecting a unit.
# 2) To match against for content assist (type completion) when editing a value of this kind of quantity.
#
# If a unit name is not defined for a given unit, but the unit is a prefixed unit and the base (or "atom")
# unit has a name, a unit name is constructed (currently) by concatenating the names or the prefix and
# the "atom" unit. If no name can be constructed for a unit, no spelled out name will be included in
# the unit description and content assist will only match against the unit symbol. A unit can explicitly
# be unnamed by setting the name to an empty string.
#
# Also, the actual symbols used to display and edit values can be overridden, but this should be used very
# sparingly. There are only two known use cases:
# 1) The year has a standardized symbol "a", for the latin "annum", in the persisting convention we use (UCUM),
# but "y" is used elsewhere and is likely more understandable for English speakers.
# 2) Languages like French use the (arguably more correct) unit "octet" with symbol "o", instead of "byte" and "B".
#
# When overridden, content assist will also match against the original identifier.
