/**
 * Encapsulates the calculation of an aggregate for (potentially) different types of items.
 * Basically this is a combination of {@link IItemConsumerFactory} that creates
 * {@link IItemConsumer}s which consumes input items and calculates intermediate values,
 * {@link IValueBuilder} which maps from the IItemConsumer intermediate values to the output value,
 * and {@link IDescribable} which provides human readable descriptions about the output value.
 *
 * @param <V>
 *            the type of the calculation result
 * @param <C>
 *            An item consumer type. See {@link IItemConsumer} about the self referring extends
 *            definition. Only really important when implementing this interface. When handling
 *            aggregator instances you can usually use {@code ?}.
