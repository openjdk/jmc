/**
 * A one dimensional affine transform, to be used on numerical quantity values (that is, the numbers
 * in front of a unit). In other words, a transformation for numbers consisting of a linear scaling
 * followed by the addition of an offset. Typically, you request a value transform from a source
 * unit to a target unit.
 * <p>
 * The transform is fully described (apart from numerical precision) by the {@link #getMultiplier()
 * multiplier} and the {@link #getOffset() offset}. These methods are intended for when the
 * transform is to be performed on a large number of primitives and possibly in conjunction with
 * other transformations. A coalesced transformation can then be applied to every primitive,
 * optimally by specialized hardware (like a GPU).
