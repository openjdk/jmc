/**
 * A display formatter is basically an identifier that tells a user interface widget how the unit
 * should be formatted, e.g. as a kilobytes. Currently the display unit doesn't contain any
 * information about what makes the unit, for instance 1 kilobyte is 1024 times as much as a byte or
 * the precision. This could be added on later by sub-classing {@link DisplayFormatter} and by
 * adding properties specific for the {@link DisplayFormatter}.
 * <p>
 * A display formatter with the magic identifier "auto" should be used to tells the user interface
 * widget that it can decide by itself how the unit should be formatted. E.g, if it is a large
 * number it may decide show it as GiB, but if it is a low number it may choose bytes.
 *
 * @param <T>
 *            the type of values that can be formatted
