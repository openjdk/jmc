AllocationByThreadRule_RULE_NAME=Threads Allocating
# {0} is a thread name
AllocationByThreadRule_TEXT_MESSAGE=The thread performing the most allocation is likely ''{0}''. This is the most common allocation path for that class: {1}
AllocationRuleFactory_TEXT_CLASS_INFO_LONG=Frequently allocated classes are likely good places to start when trying to reduce garbage collections. Look at the aggregated stack traces of the most commonly allocated classes to see if many instances are created along the same call path. Try to reduce the number of instances created by invoking the most commonly taken paths less.
AllocationRuleFactory_TEXT_THREAD_INFO_LONG=Many allocations performed by the same thread might indicate a problem in a multi-threaded program. Look at the aggregated stack traces for the thread with the highest allocation rate. See if the allocation rate can be brought down, or balanced among the active threads.

# {0} is a type name, {1} is a size in bytes, {2} is a method reference string
AutoboxingRule_RESULT_MOST_AUTOBOXED_TYPE_LONG=The most common object type that primitives are converted into is ''{0}'', which causes {1} to be allocated. The most common call site is ''{2}''.
AutoboxingRule_RESULT_AUTOBOXING_RATIO={0} % of the total allocation ({1}) is caused by conversion from primitive types to object types.
AutoboxingRule_RESULT_LONG=Conversion from primitives to the corresponding object types can either be done explicitly, or be caused by autoboxing. If a considerable amount of the total allocation is caused by such conversions, consider changing the application source code to avoid this behavior. Look at the allocation stack traces to see which parts of the code to change. This rule finds the calls to the valueOf method for any of the eight object types that have primitive counterparts.

# {0} is the classes that were filtered out from the result.
BiasedLockingRevocationRule_TEXT_EPILOGUE=<p>Biased locking is a technique used by the JVM to decrease the cost of uncontended locking to near lock free performance. A thread can bias a lock object to itself, making subsequent locking by the same thread very inexpensive. If the lock starts being used by other threads, the bias can either be revoked, rebiased towards the other thread, or revoked from being biased again for the rest of the runtime of the JVM.</p><p>Having a lot of revoked classes need not be a problem, but can provide opportunities for optimizations, tuning and design improvements. For example, if you have a lot of contention during the startup of your application, the revocation costs may be significant, and you may want to delay the enablement of biased locking using the ''-XX:BiasedLockingStartupDelay=&lt;time in ms&gt;'' flag. For applications that heavily depend on contended locking, and cannot be redesigned, it may be beneficial to turn off biased locking altogether (''-XX:-UseBiasedLocking''). For benchmarking, you may want to set ''-XX:BiasedLockingStartupDelay'' to zero.<p><p>The following classes were filtered out: {0}</p>

BufferLostRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO={0} Flight Recorder event buffer(s) with a total size of {1} were lost.
# {0} is a number, {1} is a size in bytes, {2} is a time stamp
BufferLostRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_LONG={0} Flight Recorder event buffer(s) were lost. The total size of the lost data was {1}, with the first lost buffer occurring at {2}. Buffers with events are dropped when there is an abnormally high pressure on the Flight Recorder. Avoid this by reducing the number of events recorded, especially for event types with high event rates and/or large payloads.

ClassLeakingRule_TEXT_WARN_LONG=Some classes have been loaded multiple times, and the difference between the number of times a class have been loaded and the number of times it has been unloaded has exceeded the user specified limit. This in itself need not be a problem, but check to see if you expect these classes to be loaded multiple times to make sure that you do not have a class loader leak.<p>Top {0} loaded classes:</p>
ClassLoadingRule_CONFIG_DURATION_LIMIT=Classloading duration limit
ClassLoadingRule_CONFIG_DURATION_LIMIT_LONG=The shortest classloading duration that should trigger a warning

If not, it might be good to check why these classes were being loaded.
CodeCacheRuleFactory_DEFAULT_LONG_DESCRIPTION=If the code cache is filled, the JVM will stop compiling new methods which means that your code will run slower than necessary. To avoid this, either increase the size of the code cache ('-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize') or increase the compilation threshold ('-XX:CompileThreshold').

CodeCacheRuleFactory_TEXT_WARN_LONG=This can happen if you have a lot of code in your application or if the code cache is too small. If the code cache is filled, the JVM will stop compiling new methods which means that your code will run slower than necessary. Increase the size of the code cache with '-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize', for example '-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=128M'.
CodeCacheRuleFactory_WARN_LONG_DESCRIPTION=This causes the code cache to be swept more frequently, with even higher occupancy causing more frequent sweeps.

CompressedOopsRuleFactory_TEXT_OK=The settings for Compressed Oops were OK.
ConcurrentFailedRuleFactory_TEXT_WARN=There occurred Concurrent Mode failures during certain garbage collections.
ConcurrentFailedRuleFactory_TEXT_WARN_LONG=Concurrent Mode failures means that the Garbage Collector hasn't been able to keep up with the Java Program.

DMSIncidentRuleFactory_TEXT_WARN_LONG=There are {0} reported DMS (Dynamic Monitoring Service) incidents.
DeprecatedGcRuleFactory_TEXT_WARN_PERMGEN_LONG=PermGen was removed in JDK 8, since Java users should not need to know up front how much memory to reserve for class metadata etc. Just like in the JRockit and J9 JVMs, native memory is now used for class metadata, and it will dynamically grow as needed. The equivalent of java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen will be much harder to provoke. To influence when to start attempting to reclaim metaspace memory, check out the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/java.html">MaxMetaspaceSize flag</a>.

# {0} is a count, {1} is a count, {2} is a count
FewSampledThreadsRule_TEXT_INFO_LONG={1} threads with at least {0} method samples were found, but the machine has {2} hardware threads (cores). The application might benefit from a higher level of parallelism. This could also be caused by threads doing something else than running Java code, for example running native code or spending time in the JVM internals.
FileReadRule_CONFIG_WARNING_LIMIT=File read duration warning limit

GcFreedRatioRule_RESULT_NOT_OK=This may be excessive.
# {0} is a number
GcFreedRatioRule_RESULT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION=The ratio between memory freed by garbage collections per second and liveset is {0}.

HeapInspectionGcRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_LONG=Performing heap inspection garbage collections may be a problem since they usually take a lot of time.
HeapInspectionGcRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_LONG_JFR=Some of these inspections were caused by the 'Object Count' JFR event. It triggers a full garbage collection at the beginning and end of every recording where that event is enabled. If recordings are only made on demand or not too often, then these garbage collections are usually not a problem since the resulting pauses are not part of the normal application behavior. If recordings are collected often, for example by automatic scripts, or if the application is sensitive to pauses, then it might become an issue. In that case you can consider disabling the 'Object Count' event.
HeapInspectionGcRuleFactory_TEXT_OK=The JVM did not perform any heap inspection GCs.
HeapInspectionGcRuleFactory_TEXT_OK_LONG=The JVM did not perform any heap inspection GCs. This is good since they usually take a lot of time.

HighJvmCpuRule_CONFIG_SAMPLE_LIMIT_LONG=Minimum missing samples to trigger a warning
HighJvmCpuRule_FEW_SAMPLES=This recording contains few profiling samples even though the CPU load is high.
HighJvmCpuRule_FEW_SAMPLES_LONG=The profiling data is thus likely not relevant. This might be because the application is running a lot JNI code or that the JVM is spending a lot of time in GC, class loading, JIT compilation etc.

The percentage shown for each method tells how many execution samples it was seen in compared to the maximum possible number of samples during that window.
HotMethodsRuleFactory_TEXT_OK=No methods where optimization would be particularly efficient could be detected.
IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptionsRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO=The JVM ignored unrecognized VM options.
IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptionsRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_LONG=The recording was performed on a JVM that ignored unrecognized VM options, which means that no checking was done on the presence of invalid VM flags. This means that there may be some VM behavior that you think is configured but which is not. This can be because the running VM does not support it, or because the option is misspelled. Unless it is necessary, avoid the '-XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions' command line option.

# {0} is a timestamp
IncreasingLiveSetRule_TEXT_INFO_NO_CANDIDATES=Could not find any leak candidates. This may be because all potential candidates are below the configured thresholds. It may also be a false positive due to long-lived allocations occurring after {0}, which is when the rule assumed the application would not allocate large long-lived objects anymore.
IncreasingLiveSetRule_TEXT_INFO_UNBALANCED=There are some classes that seem to leak more than other classes.
IncreasingLiveSetRule_TEXT_OK=No memory leaks were detected.
IncreasingLiveSetRule_RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD=Leak Candidate Relevance Threshold
IncreasingLiveSetRule_RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD_DESC=The calculated relevance threshold to use when determining whether or not a live object is to be considered a memory leak.
IncreasingLiveSetRule_CANDIDATE_REFERRED_BY=The candidate is referenced by this chain.
IncreasingLiveSetRule_ELLIPSIS=...
# {0} is a number
IncreasingLiveSetRule_LEAK_CANDIDATES=An analysis of the reference tree found {0} leak candidates.

# {0} is a number denoted in Mebibytes per second
IncreasingLiveSetRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO=The live set on the heap seems to increase with a speed of about {0} per second during the recording.
IncreasingLiveSetRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_LONG=This may be due to a memory leak in the application or it may be an artifact of a short recording. More information can be gathered by using the 'Old Object Sample' event, if available.
IncreasingMetaspaceLiveSetRuleFactory_RULE_NAME=Metaspace Live Set Trend
IncreasingMetaspaceLiveSetRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO=The class data seems to increase constantly in the metaspace during the recording.
IncreasingMetaspaceLiveSetRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_LONG=This behavior may indicate a memory leak in the metaspace, this could be due to the application not unloading classes as needed.
IncreasingMetaspaceLiveSetRuleFactory_TEXT_OK=The class data does not seem to increase during the recording.

LowOnPhysicalMemoryFactory_TEXT_INFO_LONG=The maximum amount of used memory was {0}. This is {1} of the {2} of physical memory available. Having little free memory may lead to swapping, which is very expensive. To avoid this, either decrease the memory usage or increase the amount of available memory.
LowOnPhysicalMemoryFactory_TEXT_OK=The system did not run low on physical memory during this recording.
ManagementAgentRule_TEXT_INFO=Management agent settings (port, authentication and/or SSL) were changed during runtime

ParGcFewThreadsRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO=The JVM ran with a parallel GC but with only one GC thread.
ParGcFewThreadsRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_LONG=The JVM ran with a parallel GC but with only one GC thread. This is not optimal. To change number of GC threads, use the command line flag <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/parallel.html">-XX:ParallelGCThreads=X</a>. When run without the '-XX:ParallelGCThreads' flag, the JVM will use a suitable number of GC threads automatically.
ParallelOnSingleCpuRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO=The runtime used a parallel GC on a single-core machine.
ParallelOnSingleCpuRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_LONG=The runtime used a parallel GC on a single-core machine. This is not optimal. Use the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/collectors.html">Serial Collector</a> instead, which is optimized for single-core machines.

SerialOldRuleFactory_TEXT_WARN_CMS_LONG=The application used the Concurrent Mark Sweep garbage collector, but the JVM had to revert to a Serial Old Collection, which takes more time. This is because the Concurrent Collector could not keep up with the object allocations that happened during the collection. You can decrease the risk of this by lowering the value of <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/cms.html">-XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction</a>.

StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_DONT_RECOMMEND_STRING_DEDUPLICATION=There is likely no big benefit from enabling string deduplication.
StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_RECOMMEND_STRING_DEDUPLICATION=Your application might benefit from enabling string deduplication.
# {0} is an event type, # {1} is an event type
StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_NO_MAX_HEAP_INFO=No information available about the maximum heap size, enable event type {0} or {1} to improve the accuracy of this rule.
StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_NO_ALLOC_ITEMS=Found no allocation events for the internal arrays in strings. Either the frame filter preference is incorrectly defined, or the stackTrace attribute is not enabled for the allocation events.
# {0} is a percentage
StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_HEAP_USAGE=The heap is around {0} % full.
# {0} is a percentage, {1} is either 'byte[]' or 'char[]'
StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_STRING_ARRAY_LIVESET_RATIO=Approximately {0} % of the live set consists of the internal array type of strings (''{1}'' for this JDK version).
# {0} is a percentage, {1} is either 'byte[]' or 'char[]'
StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_STRING_ARRAY_ALLOCATION_RATIO=Approximately {0} % of all allocations were of internal arrays in strings ({1} for this JDK version).
StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_LONG_DESCRIPTION=String deduplication is enabled using the JVM flag '-XX:+UseStringDeduplication'. This flag can be used together with the G1 garbage collector in JDK 8u20 or later.<p>To validate if this gives a performance improvement for your application, create flight recordings both with and without string deduplication. For the run with string deduplication enabled, also enable statistics with '-XX:+PrintStringDeduplicationStatistics' for JDK 8 or '-Xlog:stringdedup*=debug' for JDK 9. Check if the heap live set decrease in the recording with string deduplication enabled is larger than the size of the string deduplication metadata table. The size of the metadata table is printed in the statistics output as 'Table/Memory Usage: XX MB'<p>You can read more about string deduplication in the java options documentation or in <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/192">JEP 192</a>.
SystemGcRule_CONFIG_WARNING_LIMIT=System.gc() ratio limit
SystemGcRule_CONFIG_WARNING_LIMIT_LONG=Warning limit for ratio between System.gc() and total garbage collections
SystemGcRuleFactory_RULE_NAME=GCs Caused by System.gc()
# {0} is a percentage
SystemGcRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO={0} of the garbage collections were caused by System.gc().
SystemGcRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_LONG=Calling System.gc() might not be optimal, since it can cause an unnecessary amount of garbage collections. The garbage collectors usually handles this fine by themselves without being explicitly called.<p>To fix this, remove unnecessary System.gc() calls in the code. If the calls are made by libraries where you can't change the source code, you can instead use the command line flag '-XX:+DisableExplicitGC'. This flag makes the JVM ignore all System.gc() calls.
SystemGcRuleFactory_TEXT_OK=No garbage collections were caused by System.gc().
TlabAllocationRatioRuleFactory_RULE_NAME=TLAB Allocation Ratio
# {0} is a percentage
TlabAllocationRatioRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO=The program allocated {0} of the memory outside of TLABs.
TlabAllocationRatioRuleFactory_TEXT_RECOMMEND_LESS_ALLOCATION=Allocating objects outside of Thread Local Allocation Buffers (TLABs) is more expensive than allocating inside TLABs. This may be acceptable if the individual allocations are intended to be larger than a reasonable TLAB. It may be possible to avoid this by decreasing the size of the individual allocations. There are some TLAB related JVM flags that you can experiment with, but it is usually better to let the JVM manage TLAB sizes automatically.
TlabAllocationRatioRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_ONLY_OUTSIDE=The program only allocated objects outside of TLABs.
TlabAllocationRatioRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_ONLY_OUTSIDE_LONG=The program only allocated objects outside of Thread Local Allocation Buffers (TLABs).
TlabAllocationRatioRuleFactory_TEXT_OK_NO_OUTSIDE=No object allocations outside of TLABs detected.
UnlockExperimentalVMOptionsRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO=The recording was performed on a JVM that had Experimental VM Options enabled.
UnlockExperimentalVMOptionsRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_LONG=Due to experimental VM options not being fully supported and may thus be unreliable they should not be used in a production environment. Unless you have to use an experimental option, you should avoid the '-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions' command line option.
VMOperations_RULE_NAME=VMOperation Peak Duration
VMOperationRule_CONFIG_WARNING_LIMIT=Blocking VM operation duration warning limit
VMOperationRule_CONFIG_WARNING_LIMIT_LONG=The minimum duration for a blocking VM operation needed to trigger a warning
# {0} is a time period
VMOperationRuleFactory_TEXT_OK=No excessively long VM operations were found in this recording (the longest was {0}).
# {0} is a time period
VMOperationRuleFactory_TEXT_WARN=There are long lasting blocking VM operations in this recording (the longest is {0}).
# {0} is a time period, {1} is a time stamp, {2} is a thread name, {3} is a time stamp
VMOperationRuleFactory_TEXT_WARN_LONG=There are long lasting blocking VM operations in this recording. The longest was of type {1} and lasted for {0}. It was initiated from thread ''{2}'' and happened at {3}. <p>VM operations are JVM internal operations. Some VM operations are executed synchronously (i.e. will block the calling thread), and some need to be executed at so called safe points. Safe point polling is a cooperative suspension mechanism that halts byte code execution in the JVM. A VM operation occurring at a safe point will effectively be "stopping the world", meaning that no Java code will be executing in any thread while executing VM operations at that safe point. Long lasting VM operations executing at safe points can decrease the responsiveness of an application. <p>If you do find such VM operations, then the type of operation and its caller thread provide vital information to understand why the VM operation happened. To find more details, check if there is an event in the caller thread intersecting this event time wise. Looking at the stack trace for such an event can help determining what caused it.</p><p>See <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/groups/hotspot/docs/RuntimeOverview.html">Runtime Overview</a> for further information.</p>
