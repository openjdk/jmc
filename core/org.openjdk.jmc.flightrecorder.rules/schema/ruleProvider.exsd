         Add an extension on this extension point to allow Java Service Loader to find IRule implementations in an OSGi bundle. No attributes need to be set. All it does is give the service loader mechanism access to the classloader of the extending plugin.

         Add this to your plugin.xml file:

   &lt;extension point=&quot;org.openjdk.jmc.flightrecorder.ruleProvider&quot;&gt;
      &lt;ruleProvider&gt;&lt;/ruleProvider&gt;
   &lt;/extension&gt;
   
You also need to have a Java Service Loader services file for IRule (META-INF/services/org.openjdk.jmc.flightrecorder.rules.IRule) listing the class names of your IRule implementations.
