# {0} is a rule name, {1} is one or more event type ids
RulesToolkit_RULE_REQUIRES_UNAVAILABLE_EVENT_TYPE_LONG=The {0} rule requires the following event types: {1}.<p>They are either not available in this version of Java, or must be enabled in a third-party component. If you are using an older Java version, then you can consider upgrading.
