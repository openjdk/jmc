<shortDescription>The JVM performed 4 heap inspection garbage collections.</shortDescription>
<longDescription>The JVM performed 4 heap inspection garbage collections. Performing heap inspection garbage collections may be a problem since they usually take a lot of time.&lt;p&gt;Some of these inspections were caused by the 'Object Count' JFR event. It triggers a full garbage collection at the beginning and end of every recording where that event is enabled. If recordings are only made on demand or not too often, then these garbage collections are usually not a problem since the resulting pauses are not part of the normal application behavior. If recordings are collected often, for example by automatic scripts, or if the application is sensitive to pauses, then it might become an issue. In that case you can consider disabling the 'Object Count' event.</longDescription>

<longDescription>0 % of the total allocation (1.88 MiB) is caused by conversion from primitive types to object types.&lt;p&gt;The most common object type that primitives are converted into is 'java.lang.Integer', which causes 1.11 MiB to be allocated. The most common call site is 'weblogic.socket.NIOSocketMuxer$NIOOutputStream.initPool():887'.&lt;p&gt;Conversion from primitives to the corresponding object types can either be done explicitly, or be caused by autoboxing. If a considerable amount of the total allocation is caused by such conversions, consider changing the application source code to avoid this behavior.

The heap is around 22 % full. There is likely no big benefit from enabling string deduplication.&lt;p&gt;String deduplication is enabled using the JVM flag '-XX:+UseStringDeduplication'. This flag can be used together with the G1 garbage collector in JDK 8u20 or later.&lt;p&gt;To validate if this gives a performance improvement for your application, create flight recordings both with and without string deduplication. For the run with string deduplication enabled, also enable statistics with '-XX:+PrintStringDeduplicationStatistics' for JDK 8 or '-Xlog:stringdedup*=debug' for JDK 9. Check if the heap live set decrease in the recording with string deduplication enabled is larger than the size of the string deduplication metadata table.

Having duplicate flags is dangerous as changing one of the flags in one of the scripts may not have the intended effect. This can be especially dangerous for security related system properties. Try to find all the places where the flag is defined and keep only one. The following flags were duplicated: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Xmx&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NewSize&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dweblogic.home&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;-add-opens&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MaxNewSize&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Xms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</longDescription>
