            <explanation>1 threads with at least 4 method samples were found, but the machine has 32 hardware threads (cores). The application might benefit from a higher level of parallelism. This could also be caused by threads doing something else than running Java code, for example running native code or spending time in the JVM internals.</explanation>

            <summary>The ratio between memory freed by garbage collections per second and liveset is 6,501 %. This may be excessive.</summary>
            <explanation>242 MiB per second was freed by garbage collections during 4/26/2018 12:10:29.000 PM – 12:10:39 PM. The average liveset was 3.72 MiB. This may be excessive.
If the garbage collector can free a lot of memory, it may be because the application allocates a lot of short lived objects. Investigate the allocation stack traces to see which code paths cause the most allocations, and see if they can be reduced.

            <explanation>Throwing exceptions is more expensive than normal code execution, which means that they should only be used for exceptional situations. Investigate the thrown exceptions to see if any of them can be avoided with a non-exceptional control flow.</explanation>

            <explanation>1 threads with at least 4 method samples were found, but the machine has 32 hardware threads (cores). The application might benefit from a higher level of parallelism. This could also be caused by threads doing something else than running Java code, for example running native code or spending time in the JVM internals.</explanation>

            <summary>The most allocated type is likely ''byte[]'', most commonly allocated by: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;void java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream.&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;(int)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;void java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream.&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;()&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;void sun.management.jdp.JdpPacketWriter.&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;()&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;byte[] sun.management.jdp.JdpJmxPacket.getPacketData()&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;void sun.management.jdp.JdpBroadcaster.sendPacket(JdpPacket)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;void sun.management.jdp.JdpController$JDPControllerRunner.run()&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>
            <explanation>Frequently allocated types are good places to start when trying to reduce garbage collections. Look at where the most common types are being allocated to see if many instances are created along the same call path. Try to reduce the number of instances created by invoking the most commonly taken paths less.</explanation>

            <explanation>Many allocations performed by the same thread might indicate a problem in a multi-threaded program. Look at the stack traces for the thread with the highest allocation rate. See if the allocation rate can be brought down, or balanced among the active threads.</explanation>

            <explanation>The application performance can be affected when the machine is under heavy load and there are other processes that use CPU or other resources on the same computer. To profile representatively or get higher throughput, shut down other resource intensive processes running on the machine.</explanation>

            <explanation>If DebugNonSafepoints is not enabled, the method profiling data will be less accurate as threads that are not at safepoints will not be correctly sampled. There is a slight performance overhead when enabling these flags.

            <summary>The CMS garbage collector was used, but the JVM had to revert to do a Serial Old Collection.</summary>
            <explanation>The application used the Concurrent Mark Sweep garbage collector, but the JVM had to revert to a Serial Old Collection, which takes more time. This is because the Concurrent Collector could not keep up with the object allocations that happened during the collection. You can decrease the risk of this by lowering the value of [-XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/cms.html).</explanation>

            <explanation>At least one Full, Stop-The-World Garbage Collection occurred during this recording. For the CMS and G1 collectors, Full GC events are a strong negative performance indicator. Tunable GC parameters can be used to allow the collector to operate in concurrent mode, avoiding Stop-The-World pauses and increasing GC and application performance.</explanation>

            <explanation>At least one Full, Stop-The-World Garbage Collection occurred during this recording. For the CMS and G1 collectors, Full GC events are a strong negative performance indicator. Tunable GC parameters can be used to allow the collector to operate in concurrent mode, avoiding Stop-The-World pauses and increasing GC and application performance.</explanation>

            <explanation>Duplicated JVM flags may be caused by multiple layers of scripts used when launching the application. Having duplicate flags is dangerous as changing one of the flags in one of the scripts may not have the intended effect. This can be especially dangerous for security related system properties. The following flags were duplicated: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;-Djava.endorsed.dirs=c:\java\JDK18~1.0_6\jre\lib\endorsed;C:\tmp\WLS-JFR\oracle_common\modules\endorsed,-Djava.endorsed.dirs=c:\java\JDK18~1.0_6\jre\lib\endorsed;C:\tmp\WLS-JFR\oracle_common\modules\endorsed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;-Xverify:none,-Xverify:none&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</explanation>
            <solution>Try to find all the places where the flag is defined and keep only one.</solution>

            <summary>The JVM performed 4 heap inspection garbage collections.</summary>
            <explanation>Performing heap inspection garbage collections may be a problem since they usually take a lot of time.
Some of these inspections were caused by the 'Object Count' JFR event. It triggers a full garbage collection at the beginning and end of every recording where that event is enabled. If recordings are only made on demand or not too often, then these garbage collections are usually not a problem since the resulting pauses are not part of the normal application behavior. If recordings are collected often, for example by automatic scripts, or if the application is sensitive to pauses, then it might become an issue. In that case you can consider disabling the 'Object Count' event.</explanation>

            <summary>0.089 % of the total allocation (2.07 GiB) is caused by conversion from primitive types to object types. The most common object type that primitives are converted into is ''java.lang.Integer''.</summary>
            <explanation>
The most common object type that primitives are converted into is ''java.lang.Integer'', which causes 1.11 MiB to be allocated. The most common call site is ''weblogic.socket.NIOSocketMuxer$DirectBufferPool weblogic.socket.NIOSocketMuxer$NIOOutputStream.initPool():887''.
Conversion from primitives to the corresponding object types can either be done explicitly, or be caused by autoboxing. If a considerable amount of the total allocation is caused by such conversions, consider changing the application source code to avoid this behavior. Look at the allocation stack traces to see which parts of the code to change. This rule finds the calls to the valueOf method for any of the eight object types that have primitive counterparts.</explanation>

            <summary>Approximately 1,746 % of the live set consists of the internal array type of strings (''char[]'' for this JDK version).
The heap is around 22.3 % full. There is likely no big benefit from enabling string deduplication.</summary>
            <explanation>String deduplication is enabled using the JVM flag '-XX:+UseStringDeduplication'. This flag can be used together with the G1 garbage collector in JDK 8u20 or later, or with the Shenandoah garbage collector.
To validate if this gives a performance improvement for your application, create flight recordings both with and without string deduplication. For the run with string deduplication enabled, also enable statistics with '-XX:+PrintStringDeduplicationStatistics' for JDK 8 or '-Xlog:stringdedup*=debug' for JDK 9. Check if the heap live set decrease in the recording with string deduplication enabled is larger than the size of the string deduplication metadata table. The size of the metadata table is printed in the statistics output as 'Table/Memory Usage: XX MB'
You can read more about string deduplication in the java options documentation or in [JEP 192](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/192).&lt;p&gt;String deduplication is only supported when using the G1 (JDK 8u20+) or Shenandoah garbage collectors. If you want to use this feature you can enable G1 by using '-XX:+UseG1GC', or enable Shenandoah by using '-XX:+UseShenandoahGC'.</explanation>

            <solution>Allocating objects outside of Thread Local Allocation Buffers (TLABs) is more expensive than allocating inside TLABs. This may be acceptable if the individual allocations are intended to be larger than a reasonable TLAB. It may be possible to avoid this by decreasing the size of the individual allocations. There are some TLAB related JVM flags that you can experiment with, but it is usually better to let the JVM manage TLAB sizes automatically.</solution>

            <summary>5 duplicated JVM flags found.</summary>
            <explanation>Duplicated JVM flags may be caused by multiple layers of scripts used when launching the application. Having duplicate flags is dangerous as changing one of the flags in one of the scripts may not have the intended effect. This can be especially dangerous for security related system properties. The following flags were duplicated: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;-XX:NewSize=65m,-XX:NewSize=65m&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;-Dweblogic.home=C:\weblogic\src122130_build\Oracle_Home\wlserver/server,-Dweblogic.home=C:\weblogic\SRC122~1\ORACLE~1\wlserver\server&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;-Xmx500m,-Xmx500m&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;-Xms160m,-Xms160m&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;-XX:MaxNewSize=65m,-XX:MaxNewSize=65m&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</explanation>
            <solution>Try to find all the places where the flag is defined and keep only one.</solution>

            <explanation>The Flight Recorder is configured with a maximum captured stack depth of 64. 17.5 % of all traces were larger than this option, and were therefore truncated. If more detailed traces are required, increase the ''-XX:FlightRecorderOptions=stackdepth=&lt;value&gt;'' value.
Events of the following types have truncated stack traces: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Debug (1.59 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EJB Business Method Invoke (71.3 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EJB Business Method Post Invoke (71.3 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EJB Business Method Post Invoke Cleanup (71.3 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EJB Business Method Pre Invoke (71.3 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EJB Pool Manager Create (75 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EJB Pool Manager Post Invoke (71.3 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EJB Pool Manager Pre Invoke (71.3 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Connection Close (96.8 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Connection Prepare (100 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Connection Release (85.7 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Statement Creation (100 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Statement Execute (96.7 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Statement Execute Begin (96.7 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Transaction Commit (45 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Transaction End (45 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Transaction Is Same RM (1.79 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Transaction Start (100 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JTA Transaction Commit (36.4 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JTA Transaction End (6.06 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JTA Transaction Start (16.7 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Servlet Response Write Headers (1.87 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Webservices JAXRPC Client Request (50 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Webservices JAXRPC Client Response (100 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Webservices JAXWS Endpoint (100 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Webservices JAXWS Resource (50 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</explanation>
