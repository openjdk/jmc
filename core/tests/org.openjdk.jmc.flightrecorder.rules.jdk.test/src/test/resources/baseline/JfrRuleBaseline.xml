            <longDescription>There are fewer sampled threads than the total number of hardware threads (cores).&lt;p&gt;1 threads with at least 4 method samples were found, but the machine has 32 hardware threads (cores). The application might benefit from a higher level of parallelism. This could also be caused by threads doing something else than running Java code, for example running native code or spending time in the JVM internals.&lt;p&gt;This recording is only 9.921 s long, consider creating a recording longer than 20 s for improved rule accuracy.</longDescription>

            <longDescription>The JVM performed 4 heap inspection garbage collections. Performing heap inspection garbage collections may be a problem since they usually take a lot of time.&lt;p&gt;Some of these inspections were caused by the 'Object Count' JFR event. It triggers a full garbage collection at the beginning and end of every recording where that event is enabled. If recordings are only made on demand or not too often, then these garbage collections are usually not a problem since the resulting pauses are not part of the normal application behavior. If recordings are collected often, for example by automatic scripts, or if the application is sensitive to pauses, then it might become an issue. In that case you can consider disabling the 'Object Count' event.</longDescription>

            <longDescription>Some stack traces were truncated in this recording.&lt;p&gt;The Flight Recorder is configured with a maximum captured stack depth of 64. This is the default depth. 35.7 % of all traces were larger than this option, and were therefore truncated. If more detailed traces are required, increase the '-XX:FlightRecorderOptions=stackdepth=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;' value.&lt;p&gt;Events of the following types have truncated stack traces:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allocation in new TLAB (42.4 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class Load (42.8 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allocation outside TLAB (60.7 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EJB Pool Manager Pre Invoke (47.1 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EJB Business Method Invoke (47.1 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EJB Business Method Post Invoke Cleanup (47.1 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EJB Pool Manager Post Invoke (47.1 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EJB Business Method Post Invoke (44.4 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EJB Business Method Pre Invoke (44.4 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Servlet Execute (26.2 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Servlet Request Dispatch (45 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Method Profiling Sample (24.3 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JTA Transaction Start (80 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Transaction Start (100 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Statement Creation (54.4 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Connection Prepare (54.4 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Statement Execute (54.4 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Statement Execute Begin (54.4 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Connection Close (73 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JTA Transaction End (51.5 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JTA Transaction Commit (51 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Connection Release (65 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Transaction Commit (65 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Transaction End (65.6 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Socket Read (41.6 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;File Write (32.6 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Java Error (29.1 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Webservices JAXRPC Client Request (45.4 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Webservices JAXRPC Client Response (100 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Java Monitor Blocked (1.09 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EJB PoolManager Create (32.7 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allocation Requiring GC (31.6 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDBC Transaction Is Same RM (6.59 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Servlet Response Write Headers (0.753 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Socket Write (20.6 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Java Monitor Wait (0.134 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;File Read (100 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Java Thread Sleep (33.3 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Java Thread Park (0.223 % truncated traces)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</longDescription>

            <longDescription>Approximately 17 % of the live set consists of the internal array type of strings ('char[]' for this JDK version).
The heap is around 22 % full. There is likely no big benefit from enabling string deduplication.&lt;p&gt;String deduplication is enabled using the JVM flag '-XX:+UseStringDeduplication'. This flag can be used together with the G1 garbage collector in JDK 8u20 or later, or with the Shenandoah garbage collector.&lt;p&gt;To validate if this gives a performance improvement for your application, create flight recordings both with and without string deduplication. For the run with string deduplication enabled, also enable statistics with '-XX:+PrintStringDeduplicationStatistics' for JDK 8 or '-Xlog:stringdedup*=debug' for JDK 9. Check if the heap live set decrease in the recording with string deduplication enabled is larger than the size of the string deduplication metadata table. The size of the metadata table is printed in the statistics output as 'Table/Memory Usage: XX MB'&lt;p&gt;You can read more about string deduplication in the java options documentation or in &lt;a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/192"&gt;JEP 192&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;String deduplication is only supported when using the G1 (JDK 8u20+) or Shenandoah garbage collectors. If you want to use this feature you can enable G1 by using '-XX:+UseG1GC', or enable Shenandoah by using '-XX:+UseShenandoahGC'.</longDescription>

Event settings like period and threshold may also prevent some events from being emitted. If you are using JMC to create a flight recording, then you can enable and configure event types in the Start Flight Recording wizard. If you are starting the flight recording from the command line, then you can use the settings parameter of &lt;a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/java.html"&gt;-XX:FlightRecorderOptions&lt;/a&gt;.</longDescription>
