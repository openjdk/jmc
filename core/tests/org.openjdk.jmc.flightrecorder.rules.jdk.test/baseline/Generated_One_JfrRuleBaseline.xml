            <summary>The most allocated type is likely ''java.lang.Integer'', most commonly allocated by: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integer java.lang.Integer.valueOf(int)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;void Allocator.go()&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;void Allocator.main(String[])&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>
            <explanation>Frequently allocated types are good places to start when trying to reduce garbage collections. Look at where the most common types are being allocated to see if many instances are created along the same call path. Try to reduce the number of instances created by invoking the most commonly taken paths less.</explanation>

            <summary>The most allocations were likely done by thread ''main'' at: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integer java.lang.Integer.valueOf(int)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;void Allocator.go()&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;void Allocator.main(String[])&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>
            <explanation>Many allocations performed by the same thread might indicate a problem in a multi-threaded program. Look at the stack traces for the thread with the highest allocation rate. See if the allocation rate can be brought down, or balanced among the active threads.</explanation>

            <explanation>The application performance can be affected when the machine is under heavy load and there are other processes that use CPU or other resources on the same computer. To profile representatively or get higher throughput, shut down other resource intensive processes running on the machine.</explanation>

            <explanation>Throwing exceptions is more expensive than normal code execution, which means that they should only be used for exceptional situations. Investigate the thrown exceptions to see if any of them can be avoided with a non-exceptional control flow.</explanation>

            <summary>There are fewer sampled threads than the total number of hardware threads (cores).</summary>
            <explanation>1 threads with at least 4 method samples were found, but the machine has 32 hardware threads (cores). The application might benefit from a higher level of parallelism. This could also be caused by threads doing something else than running Java code, for example running native code or spending time in the JVM internals.</explanation>

            <summary>The ratio between memory freed by garbage collections per second and liveset is 6,501 %. This may be excessive.</summary>
            <explanation>242 MiB per second was freed by garbage collections during 4/26/2018 12:10:29.000 PM – 12:10:39 PM. The average liveset was 3.72 MiB. This may be excessive.
If the garbage collector can free a lot of memory, it may be because the application allocates a lot of short lived objects. Investigate the allocation stack traces to see which code paths cause the most allocations, and see if they can be reduced.
This recording is only 9.903 s long, consider creating a recording longer than 20 s for improved rule accuracy.</explanation>
