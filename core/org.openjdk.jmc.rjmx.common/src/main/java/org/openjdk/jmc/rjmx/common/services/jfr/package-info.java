/**
 * This package contains the service to control the flight recorder, and all classes related to that
 * service.
 * <p>
 * The following example will print the names of all ongoing recordings:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * IConnectionDescriptor descriptor = new ConnectionDescriptorBuilder().hostName("localhost").port(0).build(); //$NON-NLS-1$
 * IServerHandle serverHandle = IServerHandle.create(descriptor);
 * IConnectionHandle handle = serverHandle.connect("Get JFR recording info"); //$NON-NLS-1$
 * try {
 * 	IFlightRecorderService jfr = handle.getServiceOrThrow(IFlightRecorderService.class);
 * 	for (IRecordingDescriptor desc : jfr.getAvailableRecordings()) {
 * 		System.out.println(desc.getName());
 * 	}
 * } finally {
 * 	IOToolkit.closeSilently(handle);
 * }
 *</code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * The following will start a time bound recording, and then transfer the recording to a local file
 * when completed:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * IConnectionDescriptor descriptor = new ConnectionDescriptorBuilder().hostName("localhost").port(0).build(); //$NON-NLS-1$
 * IServerHandle serverHandle = IServerHandle.create(descriptor);
 * IConnectionHandle handle = serverHandle.connect("Start time bound flight recording");
 * try {
 * 	IFlightRecorderService jfr = handle.getServiceOrThrow(IFlightRecorderService.class);
 *
 * 	long duration = 5000;
 * 	IConstrainedMap&lt;String&gt; defaultRecordingOptions = jfr.getDefaultRecordingOptions();
 * 	IDescribedMap&lt;EventOptionID&gt; defaultEventOptions = jfr.getDefaultEventOptions();
 * 	IConstrainedMap&lt;String&gt; recordingOptions = new RecordingOptionsBuilder(defaultRecordingOptions.mutableCopy())
 * 			.name("MyRecording").duration(duration).build();
 * 	IRecordingDescriptor recording = jfr.start(recordingOptions, defaultEventOptions);
 * 	Thread.sleep(duration);
 * 	while (recording.getState() != IRecordingDescriptor.RecordingState.STOPPED) {
 * 		Thread.sleep(1000);
 * 		recording = jfr.getUpdatedRecordingDescription(recording);
 * 	}
 * 	InputStream is = jfr.openStream(recording, true);
 * 	writeStreamToFile(is);
 * } finally {
 * 	IOToolkit.closeSilently(handle);
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
