			<title>JMC 8.1 - New Release!</title>
			<description>
				This is a new minor release of Java Mission Control. The
				JMC application will now require JDK 11+ to run,
				but can still be
				used with OpenJDK 8u272+ and Oracle JDK 7u40+. It can
				also still open
				and visualize flight
				recordings from JDK 7 and 8.

			<description>
				The Mission Control client is now built to run optimally
				on Eclipse 2021-03 and later. To install Java Mission
				Control into
				Eclipse, go to the update site (Help | Install New Software...). The
				URL to the update site will be
				vendor specific, and some vendors will
				instead provide an archive with the update site.

			<description>
				A new form of light weight allocation profiling was
				introduced with JDK 16 (see

				This version of JMC supports this new type of allocation profiling.

			<title>New Page for Peeking into the Constant Pools</title>
			<description>
				There is a new page available for taking a look at what
				constants are available in the recording. This can, for example, be
				useful when creating custom events to see where all that storage and
				memory is being used.

			<description>
				For convenience, files with the .lz4 extension will now
				be attempted to be opened as flight recordings. This is since lz4 is
				a common compression to use with flight recordings.

			<synopsis>Hibernation and time</synopsis>
			<description>
				After the bugfix of
				https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6523160 in JDK 8, the
				RuntimeMXBean#getUptime() attribute was re-implemented to mean
				"Elapsed time of JVM process", whilst it previously was implemented
				as time since start of the JVM process. The uptime attribute is used
				by JMC, together with RuntimeMXBean#getStartTime(), to estimate the
				actual server time. This means that time stamps, as well as
				remaining time for a flight recording, can be wrong for processes on
				machines that have been hibernated.
