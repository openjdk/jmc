			<title>JMC 8.2 - New Release!</title>
			<description>
				This is a new minor release of Java Mission Control. The
				JMC application requires JDK 11+ to run, but can still be used to
				connect to, and parse JFR recordings from, OpenJDK 8u272+ and Oracle
				JDK 7u40+. It can also still open and visualize flight recordings
				from JDK 7 and 8.

			<description>
				The Mission Control client is now built to run optimally
				on Eclipse 2021-06 and later. To install Java Mission Control into
				Eclipse, go to the update site (Help | Install New Software...). The
				URL to the update site will be vendor specific, and some vendors
				will instead provide an archive with the update site.

			<title>Websocket for selections</title>
			<description>
				There is a new websocket API available that pushes stack
				trace data from selections in the JFR UI as JSON on a user defined
				port. This allows for programmatic control of the visualization
				directly in the browser. Tools like observablehq.com can be used to
				invent new visualizations, or to alter the visualization. To get
				started, simply go to the Flight Recorder preferences in JMC, and
				select the Websocket port to use (0 to disable). A set of example
				visualizations are available here:
				https://observablehq.com/collection/@cimi/java-mission-control.

			<synopsis>Hibernation and time</synopsis>
			<description>
				After the bugfix of
				https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6523160 in JDK 8, the
				RuntimeMXBean#getUptime() attribute was re-implemented to mean
				"Elapsed time of JVM process", whilst it previously was implemented
				as time since start of the JVM process. The uptime attribute is used
				by JMC, together with RuntimeMXBean#getStartTime(), to estimate the
				actual server time. This means that time stamps, as well as
				remaining time for a flight recording, can be wrong for processes on
				machines that have been hibernated.
