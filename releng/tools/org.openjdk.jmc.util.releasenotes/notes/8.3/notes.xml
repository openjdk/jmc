			<title>JMC 8.3 - New Release!</title>
			<description>
				This is a new minor release of JDK Mission Control. The
				JMC application requires JDK 11+ to run, but can still be used to
				connect to, and parse JFR recordings from, OpenJDK 8u272+ and Oracle
				JDK 7u40+. It can also still open and visualize flight recordings
				from JDK 7 and 8. JDK Mission Control is built for Windows (x86_64), 
				Mac OS X (ARM and x86_64), as well as Linux (x86_64).

			<description>
				The Mission Control client is now built to run optimally
				on Eclipse 2022-06 and later. To install JDK Mission Control into
				Eclipse, go to the update site (Help | Install New Software...). The
				URL to the update site will be vendor specific, and some vendors
				will instead provide an archive with the update site.

			<title>Dependency View</title>
			<description>
				There is a new view for visualizing call dependencies. There are 
				two modes of operation in the view, chord diagram and edge bundling.
				In the edge bundling visualization, hover over packages to see
				dependencies highlighted in colors: green means that methods in the 
				linked package is called by methods in the package being hovered over, 
				yellow means that methods in the linked package are calling mathods in
				the package being hovered over. Red means that methods in the packages
				are calling each other. To show the Dependency View, go to Window | Show View | 
				Other... and select the Dependency View under the Mission Control folder.

			<description>
				The graph view in JMC can now be pruned to focus on the most impactful 
				nodes. Select the target number of nodes, and the visualization will 
				show at most that many number of nodes.

			<synopsis>Hibernation and time</synopsis>
			<description>
				After the bugfix of
				https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6523160 in JDK 8, the
				RuntimeMXBean#getUptime() attribute was re-implemented to mean
				"Elapsed time of JVM process", whilst it previously was implemented
				as time since start of the JVM process. The uptime attribute is used
				by JMC, together with RuntimeMXBean#getStartTime(), to estimate the
				actual server time. This means that time stamps, as well as
				remaining time for a flight recording, can be wrong for processes on
				machines that have been hibernated.

			<synopsis>The graph, flame graph view, heatmap view and dependency view does not work on 
Windows
			</synopsis>
			<description>
				This is due to a problem with the Windows based browser
				component in SWT. We're hoping for a fix in the component for a
				future version of the Eclipse platform.
