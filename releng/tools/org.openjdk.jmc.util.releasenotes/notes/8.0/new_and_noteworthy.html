				An early access version of a Graph View is now available. The Graph View will show a directed graph
				where the individual methods are nodes in the graphs, and the edges will represent calls from one method to another.
				The size of the node will represent the "self" contribution, and the thickness of an edge will correlate with the
				number of calls from one method to another in the events. To open up the graph view, go to Window | Show view |
				Other..., then select Mission Control / Graph View. Once the Graph View has opened, it can be docked where you want
				it to be, or dragged out into a new top level window which can be handled by your window manager. Currently there is
				no graph pruning, and large graph will take a very long time to layout and render, during which the UI will freeze.
				Therefore we've imposed a user configurable limit on the number of nodes a graph can have for now.

<p>
				After the bugfix of https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6523160 in JDK 8, the
				RuntimeMXBean#getUptime() attribute was re-implemented to mean "Elapsed time of JVM process", whilst it previously
				was implemented as time since start of the JVM process. The uptime attribute is used by JMC, together with
				RuntimeMXBean#getStartTime(), to estimate the actual server time. This means that time stamps, as well as remaining
				time for a flight recording, can be wrong for processes on machines that have been hibernated.
