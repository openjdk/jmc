				rules can be enabled/disabled as you see fit. This is the very first cut - more rules and improved heuristics will be provided as part of JMC updates over time.

<b>Synopsis: </b>Hibernation and time</p>
<p>
				After the bugfix of https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6523160 in JDK 8, the RuntimeMXBean#getUptime() attribute was re-implemented
				to mean "Elapsed time of JVM process", whilst it previously was implemented as time since start of the JVM process. The uptime attribute is used by JMC,
				together with RuntimeMXBean#getStartTime(), to estimate the actual server time. This means that time stamps, as well as remaining time for a flight recording, 
				can be wrong for processes on machines that have been hibernated.
